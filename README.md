## Overview

The Shipment Delay Prediction project helps logistics companies forecast shipment delays using historical data and external factors such as weather, traffic, and shipment distance. This prediction enables better planning and decision-making.

---

## Features

- *Machine Learning*: Uses a Random Forest model for high accuracy.
- *RESTful API*: Built with Flask to provide predictions via /predict endpoint.
- *Web Interface*: A user-friendly interface to input shipment details and get predictions in real-time.
- *Deployable*: Can be deployed locally or on cloud platforms.

---

## Technologies Used

- *Python*: Core programming language for data processing and model building.
- *Flask*: API development and backend server.
- *HTML/CSS/JavaScript*: Frontend web interface.
- *Scikit-learn*: Machine learning models.
- *Pandas & NumPy*: Data preprocessing and manipulation.
- *Matplotlib*: Visualizations for exploratory data analysis.

How to Use the Project

API Usage

1. Use tools like Postman or Pythonâ€™s requests library to make POST requests to:

Endpoint: /predict

Example Input:

{
    "Origin": 3,
    "Destination": 2,
    "Vehicle Type": 1,
    "Distance (km)": 1500,
    "Weather Conditions": 1,
    "Traffic Conditions": 2,
    "Delivery Delay": 3
}

Example Output:

{
    "prediction": "Delayed"
}




Web Interface

1. Access the interface at http://127.0.0.1:5500/index.html.


2. Fill in the shipment details in the form fields.


3. Click the Predict button to see the prediction.

API Endpoints

/predict (POST)

Description: Accepts shipment details in JSON format and returns the prediction.

Input:

{
    "Origin": 3,
    "Destination": 2,
    "Vehicle Type": 1,
    "Distance (km)": 1500,
    "Weather Conditions": 1,
    "Traffic Conditions": 2,
    "Delivery Delay": 3
}

Output:

{
    "prediction": "Delayed"
}



---

Web Interface

The web interface allows users to:

Input shipment details through a simple form.

Submit the form to make a prediction using the Flask API.

View the prediction directly on the page.



---

Results

Accuracy: The Random Forest model achieved 99% accuracy on the test data.

Impact: Predicting delays improves delivery planning, reduces costs, and enhances customer satisfaction.
